Create an application named otter.py for the ubuntu cinnamon desktop that pops-up a list or group of active X applications running in the current X session for the user to select with the mouse click.
* otter will run in the background and only present it's interface with the mouse cursor is moved to y0
* Only user applications should be listed and not system application
* the list or group of applications will be presented as thumbnailed images to click on
* the mouse wheel, when activated in the list window, will scroll the list so if there are many applications running, they can all be viewed as a scrollable list
* if the ESCAPE key is pressed, or the mouse is moved off the otter window area the application should end until the mouse is moved to y0 again
* The interface should resemble the task switcher in Ubuntu cinnamon desktop (when ALT+TAB is pressed)
